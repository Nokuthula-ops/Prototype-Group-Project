Overview
This project is a collaborative prototype developed by our team to address inequality in the Education Sector, with a specific focus on minors living with disabilities. Our goal is to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to make education accessible, inclusive, and equitable for all learners‚Äîregardless of physical, cognitive, or sensory challenges.

We used Framer to design and build an interactive, user-friendly prototype that showcases our proposed solution.

Take a look at the prototype here:   https://www.loom.com/share/59a2054e21ca484c9740eee68d614ca7?sid=72d96595-0132-4274-842f-c69857babad2

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Millions of children with disabilities face barriers to accessing quality education due to physical infrastructure, lack of tailored learning resources, and limited teacher training. These challenges perpetuate inequality and hinder personal and academic growth.

OUR SOLUTION
Our AI-powered solution aims to:

üß† Personalize learning experiences based on individual needs and abilities.
üó£Ô∏è Enable multimodal communication (text, voice, visual aids) for diverse learners.
üß≠ Provide real-time support and guidance using intelligent tutoring systems.
üß© Integrate accessibility features such as screen readers, speech-to-text, and adaptive interfaces.
üìä Track progress and adapt content dynamically to ensure continuous learning.

PROTOTYPE FEATURES
